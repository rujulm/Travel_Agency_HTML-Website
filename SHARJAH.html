The Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilization was renovated and re-opened in 2008 as a significant tourist landmark in the region, and the first of its kind in the UAE. 
Situated right at the historical heart of Sharjah on the Majarrah Waterfront, this fascinating Museum started its life as a traditional Middle Eastern souq or indoor market.</P>


<P align="left">The mission of the Sharjah Museum of Islamic Civilization is to display, interpret, research and further develop the museum's collections for a wide range of local, national 
and international audiences, and to stimulate knowledge, appreciation and enjoyment of Islamic art, history, science and culture. 
The building  houses more than 5,000 exquisite artefacts from all over the Islamic World, and hosts regular exhibitions and internationally renowned displays of Islamic
 masterpieces.</FONT></P>
