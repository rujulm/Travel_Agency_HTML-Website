<P align="left"><FONT face="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="black">Qasr Al Hosn is the oldest and most significant building in Abu Dhabi, holding the city’s first permanent structure; the watchtower. Built around the 1790’s,
the commanding structure overlooked the costal trade routes and protected the growing settlement established on the island.</P>

<P align="left">Qasr Al Hosn comprises of two major iconic buildings: the Inner Fort (originally constructed in 1795) and the Outer Palace (1939-45). Over the centuries, it has been home
 to the ruling family, the seat of government, a consultative council and a national archive; it now stands as the nation’s living memorial and the narrator of Abu Dhabi’s history.
 Qasr Al Hosn is a national monument that encapsulates the development of Abu Dhabi from a settlement reliant on fishing and pearling in the 18th century, to a modern, 
global metropolis, with displays of artefacts and archival materials dating back to as far as 6000 BC.</FONT></P>
