Ride the dunes<BR>
There are few experiences that are as Wonderful as the desert safari. Take a backseat and hold on tight as an experienced driver whips you around the sand dunes,
 teetering on the edge of seemingly sheer drops, before dipping down sandy slopes and back up again. There's a couple of stops for sunset photos before you're safely 
whisked away to a traditional-style Bedouin camp, where an Arabic buffet dinner awaits.</P>

<BR>Rev up for quad biking<BR> 
<P align="left">Get An Adrenaline Rush , Available to hire by the half hour, the quad bikes are speedy and a helmet must be worn while riding. Follow the natural trail of the dunes, 
kicking sand in the face of your fellow riders. An Experience not to be missed.</FONT></P>

There’s something for all ages from toddlers to teenagers at Kite Beach, Dubai’s new hangout this winter. Toddlers will have no trouble burning off energy at the 
immaculately landscaped adventure playground The Journey in Umm Suqeim. Inside there are wooden treehouses, a mud kitchen, rope bridges, bow and arrows for 
archery, fountains to splash in, a waterfall and even a vegetable patch. Right behind, the park rubs shoulders with Jumeirah's Kite Beach, outdoor trampolines and 
Skate Park, making it a one-stop-shop for family activities. Afterwards have dinner at one of the food trucks along the corniche.</FONT></P>

Leave the skyscrapers and beaches far behind and conquer the mountains. Tucked away in the Hajar Mountains, the rocky enclave of Hatta is about a short 1.5-hour road 
trip from Dubai and home to natural springs and craggy mountain peaks. Prepare a picnic and take in some shade or stop into the Hatta Fort Hotel for lunch, where an array 
of family activities are on offer: archery, swimming, tennis and mini-golf. The more adventurous can hop onto a mountain bike and take on the many planned trails.

This futuristic waterpark spans across an area as big as 15 football pitches, with 43 rides, slides, and attractions – five of which are one-of-a-kind. Visitors at Yas Waterworld 
can experience the world’s first and largest hydro-magnetic-powered, six-person tornado waterslide that extends up to 235 meters in length. For adrenaline junkies, there are 
three-meter-high waves on Bubble’s Barrel, which has the world’s largest surf sheet wave for flow-boards and body-boards. The Bandit Bomber, a 550– meter coaster, is the 
first with onboard water and laser effects. Riders can shoot jets of water at targets, drop water bombs and trigger special effects, while people below can spray them with water as they pass.</P>

<P align="left">Sitting atop Jebel Dana, the towering core of the park’s altitude-defying summit and measuring eight meters in diameter, the park’s gigantic pearl is Yas Island’s newest 
landmark. The park draws on Abu Dhabi’s heritage with “the lost pearl” theme that follows the story of a young Emirati girl on a quest to find a legendary pearl as they make 
their way around the attractions, which include a souk and pearl-diving exhibits.<BR>
