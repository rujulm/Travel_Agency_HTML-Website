Truly a marvel of not just engineering but also imagination and design, the 828m Burj Khalifa has drawn visitors from all over the world since its opening in 2010. This
 magnificent building is the conceptual heart and soul of the city of Dubai – inspiring the viewer to imagine new possibilities. </P>

<P align="left">Inspired by an abstraction of the Hymenocallis flower, the towering structure is essentially three sections arranged around a central core. Viewed from above, it is consistent 
with the onion-dome design frequently found across a variety of Islamic architecture, albeit on a much smaller scale. 
The Burj Khalifa boasts not one but two observations decks – the two-storey At the Top on the 124th and 125th floors, as well as the world’s highest observation deck (555m) 
on the 148th floor.</P>

<P align="left">At the base of the mighty tower you will find a vibrant hub of entertainment and dining, featuring the enormous Dubai Mall, the choreographed musical Dubai Fountain and 
a plethora of tourist attractions to keep you and the fellow swarms of admirers busy.</FONT></P>
