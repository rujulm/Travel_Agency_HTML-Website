<P align="left"><FONT face="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="black">An iconic Abu Dhabi landmark, this beautiful hotel blends Arabian splendour with the latest luxuries to create a magical and memorable experience.
 During daytime, the hotel’s golden-sandy colour contrasts with its fresh green gardens, silvery water fountains and the blue sky. At night, the hotel’s lighting changes 
subtly, featuring a majestic rainbow-changing effect over the main dome.</P>
<P align="left">The main Palace building stretches over a kilometre from wing to wing, and its gardens and surroundings spread across 100 hectares. The hotel features 114 domes, 
with the central dome at an imposing 72.6 metres above ground. Gold, mother of pearl and crystals dominate the interior. The Palace has 1,002 chandeliers, the largest
 weighing 2.5 tonnes. Another memorable Palace feature is its two handmade wall display carpets, portraying the palace itself and each weighing a tonne.
Guests and visitors can wander through the majestic halls and corridors – a showcase of Arabian design, with grand central passageways and arched ceilings – and choose
 from over 200 rooms, all decorated in a comfortable style and boasting lavish cultural touches.</P>
