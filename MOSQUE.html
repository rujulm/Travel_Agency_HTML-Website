<P align="left"><FONT face="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="black">Rising majestically from manicured gardens and visible from the bridges joining the Abu Dhabi Island to the mainland, the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is an impressive 
welcome to the city. With more than 80 marble domes on a roof-line held aloft by 1000 pillars and punctuated by four 107m-high minarets, it's a masterpiece of modern
Islamic architecture and design.</P>

<P align="left">Sheikh Zayed's vision for the Grand Mosque was to incorporate architectural styles from different Muslim civilizations and celebrate cultural diversity by creating a haven 
that is truly diverse and inspirational in its foundation.</P>

<P align="left">The open-door policy invites tourists and celebrants from all around the world who can witness the spectacular onion-top domes, the reflective pools that engulf the courtyard 
and the iconic prayer hall, which not only overflows with blissful sunlight, but also houses the world’s biggest chandelier and carpet, both meticulously handmade.
The largest mosque in the country, it is the key place of worship for daily prayers, Friday gathering and Eid prayers. During Eid, it is visited by more than 41,000 
people.</FONT></P><BR>
