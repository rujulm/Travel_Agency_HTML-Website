<P align="left"><FONT face="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="black">Delve into a maze of more than 600 shops at one of the largest souks in the UAE, and discover a dazzling array of exotic handicrafts
Popularly known as the Blue Souk, due to its beautiful blue tiles, this two-storey souk consists of two long parallel buildings connected by indoor bridges. It is one of 
Sharjah’s most photographed buildings and even features on the UAE five-dirham bank note.</P> 

<P align="left">Shops on the ground floor sell modern jewellery, watches and clothing; upstairs there are arts, crafts and curios from the region, as well as stores specialising in handmade 
Persian carpets and colourful kilims from Afghanistan and Kashmir. Alongside precious stones and exquisite gold, silver and authentic Bedouin jewellery, there are craftsmen who can recreate a design based on a photo or sketch.</FONT></P>
