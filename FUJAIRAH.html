<P align="left"><FONT face="Baskerville Old Face" size="5" color="black">Fujairah Fort is a fort in the city of Fujairah, United Arab Emirates (UAE). Dating back to the 
16th century, it is the among the oldest as well as the largest castles in the country. It is noted for playing significant roles in fighting back the wave of colonialism. Today, it 
is among the main tourist attractions in the city. It is probably the oldest fort in the UAE and was occupied by the Wahhabists.</P>

<P align="left">The fort is a complex consisted of a castle, mosque and several old houses. It is guarded by three round watchtowers and a square watchtower. The watchtowers and main
 building are connected by the walls, and there is a central hall surrounded by these towers and wall. The irregular shape of the castle is due to the uneven surface of the
 rock it sits on. The sand-coloured fort overlooks the remains of at least 40 mudbrick houses. Behind it, far in the distance, are the tall buildings of modern-day Fujairah.</FONT></P>
